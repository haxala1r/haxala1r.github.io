I <i>really, <b>really</b></i> like programming.  I also like anime, scifi, books and video games.</p><p>I have been learning about various programming topics since about 2019, and I know how to program in C, C++, Python and (most recently) in Common Lisp. </p><p>I am quite enthusiastic about the whole "improving myself" thing, and I am always open to learning about new programming languages and other technologies. </p><p>Here are some examples of the kinds of personal projects I've worked on:</p><ul><li> A bot that can play Tetris way better and faster than I (or anyone I know) ever could. (written in C)</li><li> Lightweight and minimal FTP server. (C)</li><li> A portable sockets library that aims to provide a more consistent interface to sockets across both Windows and Linux (C++).</li><li> I contributed quite a lot to <a href="https://github.com/melikechan/effl-comp-olympiads">my highschool's computer olympiads training repo</a> (C)</li><li> I made an attempt at writing <a href="https://github.com/haxala1r/nettapus">an entire operating system</a>. I say "attempt" because I'm not quite satisfied with where it is right now, and I want to eventually make another attempt at it. (C and make)</li><li> A simple <a href="https://github.com/haxala1r/basic-blockchain">blockchain implementation</a>. I learnt quite a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of this data structure here. (C++)</li><li> A <a href="https://github.com/haxala1r/hcl">collection of some hash functions</a> (C)</li><li> A <a href="https://github.com/haxala1r/chip8-emulator">chip8 emulator</a> (quite buggy as of right now, sorry...) (Common Lisp)</li><li> The <a href="https://github.com/haxala1r/site-generator">static website generator</a> that was used to generate this very website! Quite impressive, eh? (Common Lisp)</li></ul><p> There are a few other things I've done, but most of it hasn't progressed to the point of presentability. I happen to be quite the perfectionist you see, so I don't really want to show the "incomplete" stuff. I even had my doubts about some of the stuff here...</p><p>Anyway, that's my introduction page. Hopefully I'll add some other stuff to this site later. Like a blog, IDK... and maybe less self-doubt? Oh who am I kidding. There's <b><i>always</i></b> self-doubt, <i>no matter what you do.</i> </p></div></div></body></html>
