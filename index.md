# Hello world!

I'm haxala1r, and I really like programming. I *really, **really*** like programming. 
I also like anime, scifi, books and video games.

I have been learning about various programming topics since about 2019, and I know
how to program in C, C++, Python and (most recently) in Common Lisp. 

I am quite enthusiastic about the whole "improving myself" thing, and I
am always open to learning about new programming languages and other technologies. 

Here are some examples of the kinds of personal projects I've worked on:

- A bot that can play Tetris way better and faster than I (or anyone I know) ever could. (written in C)
- Lightweight and minimal FTP server. (C)
- A portable sockets library that aims to provide a more consistent interface to sockets across both Windows and Linux (C++).
- I contributed quite a lot to [my highschool's computer olympiads training repo](https://github.com/melikechan/effl-comp-olympiads) (C)
- I made an attempt at writing [an entire operating system](https://github.com/haxala1r/nettapus). I say "attempt" because I'm not quite satisfied with where it is right now, and I want to eventually make another attempt at it. (C and make)
- A simple [blockchain implementation](https://github.com/haxala1r/basic-blockchain). I learnt quite a lot about the strengths and weaknesses of this data structure here. (C++)
- A [collection of some hash functions](https://github.com/haxala1r/hcl) (C)
- A [chip8 emulator](https://github.com/haxala1r/chip8-emulator) (quite buggy as of right now, sorry...) (Common Lisp)
- The [static website generator](https://github.com/haxala1r/site-generator) that was used to generate this very website! Quite impressive, eh? (Common Lisp)

There are a few other things I've done, but most of it hasn't progressed to the point of presentability.
I happen to be quite the perfectionist you see, so I don't really want to show the "incomplete" stuff.
I even had my doubts about some of the stuff here...

Anyway, that's my introduction page. Hopefully I'll add some other stuff to this site later.
Like a blog, IDK... and maybe less self-doubt? Oh who am I kidding. There's ***always*** self-doubt,
*no matter what you do.*
